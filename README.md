# Marshall Wace x CUCaTS 2025 Workshop
Welcome to our workshop! There will be a couple of optional tasks both centred
around data analysis and implementation.

In task A you will be asked to recreate the implementation of a data frame from
scratch.

In task B you have the opportunity to do some data analysis on the 2025
stackoverflow developer survey.

## Prerequisites
Both tasks are written in python on jupyter notebooks.
If run in Google colab, they should download the necessary dependencies when
run. Otherwise you can find the `environment.yml` file to set up a conda/mamba
environment. You can use the command `conda env create -f environment.yml` in order to do this (or replace `conda` with `mamba`).

## Submission
We would love to see what solutions you come up with!
Please send us a link to your repository by midnight on Sunday 9th November
for a chance to win some exclusive prizes. No need to be perfect or complete 
both tasks!
